### Introduction

In today's fast-paced business world, retail sales performance is a key indicator of a company's success. The downstream oil and gas sector is no exception, with a constantly changing landscape and a highly competitive market. This report summarizes retail sales performance data sourced from Sage Business Cloud ERP for the year 2022 and presents insights into retail station performance, PMS, AGO, and lubricant sales across regions, as well as the factors that influenced outcomes.

### Data Cleaning and Transformations

To create this dashboard, I sourced data from an enterprise resource planning API. ERP extracts are usually characterized by several variables due to its robust architecture. To suit the purpose of this report, I employed modeling and data standardization using Power Query within Power BI to ensure that the data was consistent and accurate. Finally, the data was visualized using Power BI.

### Main Findings

- **PMS Sales:** Active expansion activities saw the number of active stations rise to 70 as of December 2022, with plans to increase this number significantly in 2023. As a result of this expansion, PMS volume sales in 2022 surpassed that of 2021 by over 10 million liters. Collaboration with the logistics department and improved product supply influenced these volumes. However, more could have been achieved if not for product supply challenges in certain regions.
- **AGO Sales:** AGO sales suffered a dip in 2022 by over one million liters. Product supply challenges coupled with unstable product pricing significantly affected sales performance. Despite the challenges, AGO sales performance peaked in June 2021 and 2022, with poor sales performance in January and February. Sales challenges continued into March and April, and stable conditions resumed in May.
- **Lubricant Sales:** Lubricant sales suffered a dip of over 92,000 liters. Lubricant sales performance was significantly affected by a price increase that occurred in Q3 and Q4 of 2022. Stiff competition from other manufacturers also impacted sales performance, particularly in North 2. Lubricant sales performance peaked in March for H1 2021 and H1 2022, with low sales performance in terms of lubricant sales all through H1 2022.
- **Top Performing Regions:** The West region contributed almost half **(44.25%)** of the revenue generated across all regions. This was reflected in the revenue contribution list by stations where Gbagada, Osapa, Asese, and Agungi rank top 4, all located in the West region. In H2 2022, the West region contributed 33.8% of the revenue generated, with Asese, Osapa, and Gbagada ranking top 3 in revenue contribution.

### Conclusion

The end-of-year retail sales performance report for 2022 highlights the challenges and successes in the downstream oil and gas sector. While the expansion of retail stations and improved product supply led to an increase in PMS sales volume, AGO sales and lubricant sales experienced challenges. Continued efforts to improve sales performance for all products, including better supply chain management and price optimization strategies, are being implemented to achieve greater sales volumes and revenue contribution across all regions and stations.
