    "This project will be investigating the 'No-show appointments' dataset for hospital appointment attendance status and other characteristics for 100,000 patients in Brazil, South America.\n",

    "In particular, I will be exploring trends concerning attendance rates between male and females, factors that may or may not have influenced attendance such as SMS prompts, welfare enrolments and Handicap level, average age of attendees and non-attendees.\n",
    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.\n",
    "‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.\n",
    "‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.\n",
    "‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    "- What age ranges are more likely to honor appointments as well as the ages that most likely wouldn't?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does SMS prompts play an important role in appointment showup rates?\n",

Although slightly younger observations were highlighted in the male category. Question two investigated the influence of SMS prompts on attendance of appiontment. Analysis shows that SMS prompts do not necessarily affect the percentage of people that honored their appointments. Lastly, welfare enrollment distribution amongst gender was investigated and analysis revealed that a lot lesser percentage of men are enrolled in welfare programmes as opposed to women. However, there is a generally low enrolment rate for across the dataset.\n",
