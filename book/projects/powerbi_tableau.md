### Objectives and Primary Goal:
Analyze ATB branch performance to identify opportunities for transitioning client activity from physical branches to digital channels.

**Specific Objectives:**
- Identify underperforming branches or states.
- Highlight high-performing branches to replicate success.

### Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes deposit information for ATB Financial branches from 2010 to 2016, including:
- **Branch Types:** Walk-In, Drive-Thru
- **Deposit Amounts:** Total dollar amounts at each branch.
- **Geographic Locations:** State, county, city, and branch details.
- **Year:** Spanning 2010 to 2016.

<div style="max-width: 800x;">

### Initial Insights:

- Total Deposits: exactly **$12.65 billion**  has been deposited between 2010 and 2016. A further breakdown shows that, of the **$12.65 billion** deposited, **$26.43 million** was via drive-thrus while **$12.63 billion** was through walk-in branches
- Total Branches: There are a total of **5,413** branches of ATB as of July 16, 2016 when this dataset was generated. **100** of these branches are drive-thrus while **5,313**are walk-in branches
- Average Deposits per Branch: Based on these numbers, initial assumption informs that each drive-thru branch received deposits of an average of **$264,322.37** between 2010 and 2016 and each physical branch received deposits of an average of **$2,376,553.74** between 2010 and 2016

### Key Findings - Deposit Trends:
- Walk-in branches significantly outperform drive-thru branches.
- Acquired branches contribute over **90%** of drive-thru deposits.
- States like Ohio and New York show high deposit volumes, while Pennsylvania shows $0 despite proximity to high performers.

### Recommendations:
1. **Target High-Performing Regions:** Focus on states with high deposits and favorable GDP per capita.
2. **Divest Low-Performing Regions:** Close branches with consistently low deposits.
3. **Enhance Digital Channels:** Incentivize web and drive-thru services to foster adoption.
4. **Customer Support:** Provide localized support for non-tech-savvy customers.

## Retail Sales Annual Report (Oil & Gas)
### Introduction:
