    "# CRUD Web GIS: Build Process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This webmap is a CRUD-capable GIS application built with Leaflet on the frontend and PHP + PostGIS on the backend. The UI provides map navigation, sidebar-driven feature tools, and create/update/delete workflows for multiple infrastructure layers (valves, pipelines, buildings). Data is persisted in a spatial database and served as GeoJSON to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Live demo: https://webmap.kunmiadebanjo.com/\n",
    "Source repo (reference implementation): https://github.com/Khunmi/webmap_backup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "- Frontend: Leaflet map UI with plugins, AJAX calls to PHP endpoints, GeoJSON rendering.\n",
    "- Backend: PHP API endpoints for CRUD and lookup operations.\n",
    "- Database: PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL (inferred from `ST_AsGeoJSON` and `ST_GeomFromGeoJSON`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level flow\n",
    "1. User loads the webmap and selects a DMA (area filter).\n",
    "2. Frontend calls backend endpoints to load features by DMA.\n",
    "3. GeoJSON is returned and rendered by Leaflet with styling and tooltips/popups.\n",
    "4. Edits and deletes occur from popups, inserts from sidebar forms, all handled via AJAX POST to PHP endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frontend build (Leaflet UI)\n",
    "Key file: `index.php`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries and plugins\n",
    "- Leaflet 1.7\n",
    "- Bootstrap 3.4 for layout and form styling\n",
    "- jQuery + jQuery UI (autocomplete)\n",
    "- Leaflet Sidebar (tabbed sidebar)\n",
    "- Leaflet Geoman (drawing tools)\n",
    "- Leaflet PolylineMeasure (measurement tool)\n",
    "- MiniMap and ZoomBar controls\n",
    "- SweetAlert2 for confirmation dialogs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map setup\n",
    "- Base layers: Google Streets, OpenStreetMap, CartoDB Positron, Esri World Imagery, OpenTopoMap\n",
    "- Controls: sidebar, layer control, scale, minimap, polyline measure, geoman drawing\n",
    "- Default view: centered around `[23.7923, 90.4167]` with zoom 13\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer logic\n",
    "- **Valves**: point layer with circle markers, styled by `valve_type`.\n",
    "- **Pipelines**: line layer styled by `pipeline_category`.\n",
    "- **Buildings**: polygon layer styled by `building_category` and `building_storey`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer includes:\n",
    "- Tooltip for quick inspection\n",
    "- Popup form with editable attributes and Update/Delete actions\n",
    "- Autocomplete search by ID (valve_id, pipe_id, account_no)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawing + insert workflow\n",
    "Geoman drawing creates a geometry, then writes GeoJSON into a hidden textarea:\n",
    "- Marker -> Point (valves)\n",
    "- Line -> MultiLineString (pipelines)\n",
    "- Polygon -> MultiPolygon (buildings)\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert forms collect attributes + geometry and POST to `insert_data.php`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backend build (PHP + PostGIS)\n",
    "Key files: `init.php`, `load_data.php`, `find_data.php`, `insert_data.php`, `update_data.php`, `delete_data.php`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database connection\n",
    "`init.php` reads database config from `/home/kunmiade/config/db.php` or environment variables:\n",
    "- `WEBMAP_DSN`\n",
    "- `WEBMAP_DB_USER`\n",
    "- `WEBMAP_DB_PASS`\n",
    "\n",
    "If config is missing, the API exits with an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write security token\n",
    "Write operations require a token (via header `X-WEBMAP-TOKEN` or POST `token`).\n",
    "Token is read from config or `WEBMAP_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read endpoints\n",
    "- `load_data.php`: loads features for a selected DMA\n",
    "- `find_data.php`: returns a feature by ID\n",
    "\n",
    "Both endpoints return GeoJSON FeatureCollections using `ST_AsGeoJSON(geom)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write endpoints\n",
    "- `insert_data.php`: validates unique IDs, inserts with `ST_GeomFromGeoJSON` and SRID 4326\n",
    "- `update_data.php`: updates attributes with checks for unique IDs\n",
    "- `delete_data.php`: deletes by database primary key\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data model (as used by the app)\n",
    "Tables referenced by the frontend:\n",
    "- `valves`\n",
    "  - ids and attributes: `valve_id`, `valve_type`, `valve_dma_id`, `valve_diameter`, `valve_visibility`, `valve_location`\n",
    "  - geometry: `geom`\n",
    "- `pipelines`\n",
    "  - ids and attributes: `pipe_id`, `pipeline_category`, `pipeline_dma_id`, `pipeline_diameter`, `pipeline_material`, `pipeline_location`, `length`\n",
    "  - geometry: `geom`\n",
    "- `buildings`\n",
    "  - ids and attributes: `account_no`, `building_category`, `building_dma_id`, `building_storey`, `building_population`, `building_location`\n",
    "  - geometry: `geom`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment notes\n",
    "- The live webmap serves the same PHP-based frontend and backend.\n",
    "- Make sure the server includes PHP + PDO + PostGIS support.\n",
    "- Store database credentials and the write token in `/home/kunmiade/config/db.php` or environment variables to avoid exposing secrets in source control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I would improve next\n",
    "- Move hardcoded base layers and API paths into a config file.\n",
    "- Add input validation and server-side request rate limiting.\n",
    "- Use prepared geometry validation to avoid invalid shapes.\n",
    "- Add a lightweight authentication screen or user roles for write access.\n",
    "- Add backups and migrations for the spatial database.\n"
